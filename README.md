# SmartLight

As a computer science student, I didn't realize I had to spend hundreds of dollars on a system like Philips Hue. So I decided to develop my own smart lighting system. After several hundred hours of work, a lot of joy but also frustration "SmartLight V3" was created.

## What can SmartLight do?

* You can use cheap RGB LED strips as well as more complex NeoPixel strips.
* The basic module \(ESP8266-01\) costs less than 5â‚¬.
* modern Web-App that you can add to your Homescreen.
* support for IFTTT & Google Home \(via IFTTT\)
